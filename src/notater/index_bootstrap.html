<b>Summary.</b> <p>
The literature in mechanics is full of different and sometimes confusing
notation. Once in a while, the notations are mixed and errors may occur if one
is not careful. This is particularly true when we enter into the world of
second-order tensors (matrices). This note covers some of the basic material on
notation in an attempt to bring some clarity.

<h2 id="___sec0" class="anchor">Fields </h2>
In physics we deal with several different fields, usually defined in
three-dimensional Euclidean space \( \mathcal{R}^3 \). A scalar field is recognized
simply by its magnitude, that may vary throughout space. Examples of scalar
fields are temperature and density. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector" target="_self">vector</a> is a field, or physical
quantity, that has both magnitude and direction. Examples are the fluid velocity
(one velocity component for each space dimension), deformation, electric or
magnetic fields. Even though it has direction, a vector is independent of
coordinate system, and many different coordinate systems can be used to describe
the same vector. A tensor is often used when speaking of fields with higher
order than vectors, even though a vector can be considered a tensor of order
one, and a scalar a tensor of order 0. In general a tensor is a field whose
components are represented through a number of indices (the number of indices
determines its order), and that is invariant in form after a transformation of
the coordinate system.

<p>
Introducing a coordinate system through unit vectors \( \boldsymbol{i}_1, \boldsymbol{i}_2 \) and
\( \boldsymbol{i}_3 \), a vector field may be represented as
$$
\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{u} = u_1 \boldsymbol{i}_1 + u_2\boldsymbol{i}_2 + u_3
\boldsymbol{i}_3 = \sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \boldsymbol{i}_i.  
\end{equation} 
\label{eq:u_vec2}
$$

<p>
A Cartesian coordinate system is often define with unit vectors \( \bs{i}_1 = (1, 0, 0), \bs{i}_1=(0, 1, 0) \) and
\( \bs{i}_3=(0, 0, 1) \), with origin \( (0,0,0) \) defined as where the three vectors meet. If nothing is stated explicitly about the coordinate
system, then it is safe to assume that this is the coordinate system in use.

<p>
A vector is sometimes denoted simply as

$$
\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3), 
\end{equation} 
\label{eq:u_vec}
$$

<p>
where \( (u_1, u_2, u_3) \) are the three components of the vector \( \boldsymbol{u} \)
in the coordinate system that is in use. The components can always be found from

$$
u_i = \bs{u} \cdot \bs{i}_i. 
$$

<p>
We note that \( \boldsymbol{u} \), with a boldface font, is not the only way to
represent a vector. Equally common are \( \overrightarrow{u}, \underline{u},
\overline{u} \), sometimes also in a boldface font. We will only make use of the bold
type.

<p>
The notation used in \eqref{eq:u_vec}, boldface without explicitly stating the unit
vectors, is usually referred to as vector notation, but sometimes it is also called
<em>symbolic</em>, <em>absolute</em>, <em>invariant</em> or <em>direct</em> notation. We will here stick
with vector notation.

<p>
In the notation on the right hand side of \eqref{eq:u_vec2} the unit vectors \( \boldsymbol{i}_1, \boldsymbol{i}_2 \) and \( \boldsymbol{i}_3 \) 
are explicitly included as well as the components, and this
notation is often referred to as component form. The expressions on component
form are rather long, though, and this motivated a simplified version that is
using the <em>summation convention</em>

$$
\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{u} = u_i \boldsymbol{i}_i.  
\label{_auto1}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
Here the two repeated indices \( i \) indicate that the expression must be summed over
the entire length of the index \( i \), and it is often referred to as Einstein's summation
convention. The result of summing the index \( i \) from \( 1 \) to \( 3 \) is of course
exactly the same as seen in Eq. \eqref{eq:u_vec2}.

<p>
Using the component form without explicitly stating the basis vectors leads to
the very popular index notation. With the index notation (or <em>suffix</em>, <em>indical</em>
or <em>subscript</em> notation) expressions are written on component form and we use
simply \( u_i \) to refer to <em>component</em> i of the
vector \( \boldsymbol{u} \). The index form is used with the summation convention,
such that, for example, the dot product becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bs{u} \cdot \bs{v} = u_i v_i.
\end{equation*}
$$

<p>
Papers or books that are primarily using index
notation, usually also use the additional vector notation to represent the
entire vector, when this is deemed necessary. Furthermore, the index notation
usually skips the unit vectors, something that is made clear in the next
section.

<p>
Note also that the index notation without explicit use of basis vectors is only valid
for a Cartesian coordinate system. The Cartesian unit or basis vectors
obviously satisfy

$$
\begin{equation}
\bs{i}_i \cdot \bs{i}_j = \begin{cases} 
  1 \quad \text{if } i = j \\
  0 \quad \text{if } i \ne j
 \end{cases}
\label{_auto2}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
and are for this reason referred to as an orthonormal basis.

<h2 id="___sec1" class="anchor">Operations on fields that do not require derivatives </h2>

<p>
The most common operations on fields that do not require derivatives are the scalar product
(also called inner or dot product), outer product and cross product. We will here show how they can all be
written with different types of notation.

<h3 id="___sec2" class="anchor">Inner product </h3>

<p>
The inner product between two vectors \( \boldsymbol{u} \) and \( \boldsymbol{v} \)
equals a scalar (\( \alpha \)) and is given in vector notation as 

$$
\begin{align} \alpha &= \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}, 
\label{_auto3}\\  
&= (u_1, u_2, u_3) \cdot (v_1, v_2, v_3), 
\label{_auto4}\\ 
&= u_1v_1 + u_2 v_2 + u_3v_3.  
\label{_auto5}
\end{align} 
$$

<p>
With index notation we obtain the same result simply by writing 
$$
\begin{equation} \alpha = u_i v_i.  
\label{_auto6}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
To show that this agrees with unity vectors

$$
\begin{align} \alpha &= \sum_{i=1}^3 u_i\boldsymbol{i}_i \cdot \sum_{j=1}^3
v_j \boldsymbol{i}_j, 
\label{_auto7}\\ 
&= \sum_{i=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^3 u_iv_j \boldsymbol{i}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{i}_j,  
\label{_auto8}\\ 
&=  u_1v_1 + u_2 v_2 + u_3v_3 
\label{_auto9}
\end{align} 
$$

<p>
Here the last equality follows from retaining only the non-zero terms of the
double summation. That is, only the terms with \( i=j \) are nonzero because
\( \boldsymbol{i}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{i}_j = 1 \) if and only if \( i=j \), whereas it
is zero if \( i \ne j \).

<h3 id="___sec3" class="anchor">Cross product </h3>

<p>
The cross product between two vectors \( \boldsymbol{u} \) and \( \boldsymbol{v} \) is a
new vector \( \boldsymbol{a} \) (it is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector" target="_self">pseudovector</a>)

$$
\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{a} = \boldsymbol{u} \times \boldsymbol{v}.
\label{_auto10}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
The cross product between \( \boldsymbol{u} \) and \( \boldsymbol{v} \) is a vector with
direction normal to the plane spanned by \( \boldsymbol{u} \) and \( \boldsymbol{v} \).
However, the actual direction also depends on the chosen <em>handedness</em> of the
coordinate system. We use a right-handed coordinate system, meaning that if
you point your right thumb in the direction of \( \boldsymbol{u} \) and your right
index finger in the direction of \( \boldsymbol{v} \), then your remaining three
fingers, when bended an angle of \( 90^0 \), will point in the defined normal direction of the plane spanned by
\( \boldsymbol{u} \) and \( \boldsymbol{v} \). Right- and left-handed coordinate systems
are illustrated in the figure below

<p>
<br /><br /><center><p><img src="figs/left_right_hand.gif" align="bottom" ></p></center><br /><br />

<p>
The cross product is defined as

$$
\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{u} \times \boldsymbol{v} = \lVert
\boldsymbol{u}\rVert \, \lVert \boldsymbol{v} \rVert \, \sin (\theta) \,
\boldsymbol{n}, 
\label{_auto11}
\end{equation} 
$$

where \( \lVert \boldsymbol{u} \rVert \)
represents the magnitude of \( \boldsymbol{u} \) and \( \theta \) is the angle between
the two vectors in the plane they span. The vector \( \boldsymbol{n} \) is the
normal vector to the same plane, in the direction determined by the <em>handedness</em>.

<p>
The cross product is often defined as the determinant of the matrix

$$
\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{u} \times \boldsymbol{v} = \det \begin{vmatrix}
\boldsymbol{i}_1 & \boldsymbol{i}_2 & \boldsymbol{i}_3 \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1
& v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} 
\label{_auto12}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
With index notation the cross product may be defined using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_symbol" target="_self">Levi-Civita</a> symbol

$$
\begin{equation} \varepsilon_{ijk} = \begin{cases} +1 &\text{if} \,\, ijk
\,\, \text{is in the sequence } 123123, \\ -1 &\text{if} \,\, ijk \,\,  \text{is
in the sequence } 321321, \\ 0 &\text{otherwise.} \end{cases} 
\label{_auto13}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
The Levi-Civita symbol is a third-order tensor and also an isotropic tensor,
meaning that it has the same value in any coordinate system. Another well-known
isotropic tensor is the second-order Kronecker delta

$$
\begin{equation} \delta_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 \quad &\text{if } i=j \\ 0
\quad &\text{otherwise}.  \end{cases} 
\label{_auto14}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
Using the Levi-Civita symbol the cross product may be written with index
notation as

$$
\bs{a} = \varepsilon_{ijk} u_j v_k \bs{i}_i.  
$$

<p>
The final \( \bs{i}_i \) is redundant with index notation and it is more common to use the
component form

$$
a_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} u_j v_k, 
$$

<p>
where \( i \) is the only free index.

<h3 id="___sec4" class="anchor">The outer product </h3>

<p>
The outer product (also called dyadic or tensor product) between vectors
\( \bs{u} \) and \( \bs{v} \) creates a second-order tensor (or a dyadic) \( \bs{P} \), and
is denoted using a wide range of different vector or index notations

$$
\begin{align} 
\bs{P} &= \bs{u} \otimes \bs{v} \label{eq:outer1}\\ \bs{P} &= \bs{u} \bs{v}
\label{eq:outer2}\\
\bs{P} &= u_iv_j\bs{i}_i\bs{i}_j  \label{eq:outer3}\\ \bs{P} &= u_iv_j\bs{i}_i
\otimes \bs{i}_j \label{eq:outer4} \\
P_{ij} &= u_iv_j 
\label{_auto15}\\ 
\label{_auto16}
\end{align} 
$$

<p>
Evidently, the simplest approach is to take the lack of a dot as representing an
outer product, as seen in \eqref{eq:outer2}. The indices and unit vectors indicate the components location in
a matrix. The first and second index, i.e., \( i \) and \( j \), represent the matrix's
row and column, respectively.  

$$
\begin{equation} 
P_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix} P_{11} & P_{12} & P_{13} \\ P_{21}
& P_{22} & P_{23} \\ P_{31} & P_{32} & P_{33} \end{pmatrix} 
\label{_auto17}
\end{equation} 
$$

<h2 id="___sec5" class="anchor">Operations that require derivatives </h2>

<h3 id="___sec6" class="anchor">The gradient of a scalar field </h3>

<p>
The gradient is the only operation that increases the order when applied to a
tensor. When applied to a zero'th-order scalar, the result is a vector of order
one. We define the gradient by considering infinitesimal changes in the field
\( f \) along direction \( \boldsymbol{dx} \)

$$
\begin{equation} df = \text{grad} \, f \cdot \boldsymbol{dx}. 
\label{_auto18}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
In a Cartesian coordinate system this can be written as either one of

$$
\begin{align}
df &= \nabla f \cdot \bs{dx}, 
\label{_auto19}\\ 
df &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} dx_i, 
\label{_auto20}\\
df &=  \bs{i}_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \cdot \bs{i}_j dx_j =
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}dx_j \bs{i}_i  \cdot \bs{i}_j = \frac{\partial
f}{\partial x_i} dx_i,
\label{_auto21}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
and we likewise have that the gradient can be written as
$$
\begin{align}
\text{grad}\, f &= \nabla f , 
\label{_auto22}\\ 
\text{grad}\, f &= \bs{i}_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}, \label{eq:gradf_2}\\
(\text{grad}\, f)_i &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}. \label{eq:gradf_3} \\
\label{_auto23}
\end{align}
$$

Note that out of these three different ways of writing the gradient of a scalar,
only the first, \( \text{grad} \, f = \nabla f \), is valid for a general coordinate
system. The other two are valid for a Cartesian coordinate system. Equation
\eqref{eq:gradf_2} requires additional scaling factors to be valid for
curvilinear coordinate systems, whereas the index notation in \eqref{eq:gradf_3}
never can be used for any other coordinate system than the Cartesian.

<h3 id="___sec7" class="anchor">The \( \nabla \) operator </h3>

<p>
The nabla operator \( \nabla \) plays a central role in the mathematical description
of fundamental theorems, like the principles for conservation of mass, and
the balance of momentum, which is Newton's second law applied to fluids.

<p>
There are basically two directions taken for the mathematical nabla operator. One direction
uses it straightforward as a vector, and the other uses it as an operator. This
will become evident in Secs. <a href="#sec:grad_vector">The gradient of a vector</a> and <a href="#sec:div_tensor">The divergence of a tensor</a> when
nabla is used to describe the gradient of a vector and the divergence of a
tensor. For the gradient of a scalar or the divergence of a vector, the two
different approaches are both the same.

<p>
When the nabla operator is interpreted as the vector, we can write it as

$$
\begin{equation}
\nabla = \bs{i}_i\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i}, \label{eq:nabla_1}
\end{equation}
$$

but note that this is only valid for Cartesian coordinate systems.

<p>
By defining nabla as an operator, we apply it as \eqref{eq:nabla_1} to scalars,
but as
$$
\begin{equation}
\nabla = \frac{\partial (\cdot)}{\partial x_i} \otimes \bs{i}_i,
\label{_auto24}
\end{equation}
$$

when applied to higher order tensors \( (\cdot) \). With this latter approach, the
spatial derivative becomes the last index in the resulting tensor, whereas with the
\eqref{eq:nabla_1} approach, the spatial derivative becomes the <em>first</em>
index of the resulting tensor. For the gradient of a scalar the first and last
index is the same, so there is no difference.

<p>
<!-- For a curvelinear -->
<!-- coordinate system \( u_i(x_j) \) (instead of \( x_i \)), the expression -->
<!-- needs to account for scaling factors \( h_j = |\partial x_i/\partial u_j| \) as well -->
<!-- !bt -->
<!-- \nabla = \sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\bs{i}_i}{h_i}\frac{\partial }{\partial u_i}, -->
<!-- !et -->

<h3 id="___sec8" class="anchor">The divergence of a vector field </h3>

<p>
The divergence of a vector field \( \bs{u} \) is defined as the surface integral of
\( \bs{u} \cdot \bs{n} \) over a surface surrounding a point P

$$
\begin{equation}
\text{div}\, \bs{u} = \lim_{\delta V \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\delta
V}\oint_{\delta S} \bs{u} \cdot \bs{n} ds \label{eq:divu}
\end{equation}
$$

where \( \delta V \) is a small volume enclosing P, with surface \( \delta S \). In
Cartesian coordinates this corresponds to the dot product between the vector
nabla and the vector \( \bs{u} \), which can be written as either one of 

$$
\begin{equation}
 \nabla \cdot \bs{u}, \quad \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i}, \quad \bs{i}_i
\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i} \cdot u_j \bs{i}_j
\label{_auto25}
\end{equation}
$$

<h3 id="sec:grad_vector" class="anchor">The gradient of a vector</h3>

The gradient of a vector is a second order tensor. This is where much
confusion arise in the literature, because a second order tensor \( \bs{P} \) can be transposed,
and in general

$$
\begin{equation}
P_{ij} \ne P_{ji} \quad \text{or} \quad \bs{P} \ne \bs{P}^T.
\label{_auto26}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Or, perhaps more evident

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} \ne \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}.
\label{_auto27}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
If we define the gradient of a vector as right multiplication

$$
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:gradu}
d\bs{u} = \text{grad} \, \bs{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{dx},
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
then the spatial derivative must be represented in second index (the columns) of the tensor,
and we get 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{grad}\, \bs{u} &= \frac{\partial u_i \bs{i}_i}{\partial x_j} \otimes
\bs{i}_j, 
\label{_auto28}\\
  &=  \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} \bs{i}_i \otimes \bs{i}_j,
\label{eq:gradu_2}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
or similarily
$$
\begin{equation}
\text{grad}\, \bs{u} = \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}.
\label{_auto29}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Now, some authors like to identify \( \nabla \) with this gradient operator, such that 

$$
\text{grad} \, \bs{u} = \nabla \bs{u} = \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}.
$$

<p>
However, some authors do not identify the gradient to be the definition in
\eqref{eq:gradu}, and simply work with the nabla operator as a regular vector.
In this case the outer product of the nabla
operator \( \nabla \) and the vector \( \bs{u} \) is

$$
\begin{align}
  \nabla \otimes \bs{u}  &= \bs{i}_i \frac{\partial }{\partial x_i} \otimes u_j \bs{i}_j 
\label{_auto30}\\
   & = \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} \bs{i}_i \otimes \bs{i}_j,
\label{eq:graduT}
\end{align}
$$

which is the transpose of Eq. \eqref{eq:gradu_2}. Equation \eqref{eq:graduT}  may
also be written as

$$
\begin{equation}
 \nabla \bs{u} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}.
\label{_auto31}
\end{equation} 
$$

<p>
Note that either style of writing is correct in itself, and as long as it is
made clear which definitions are being used, then there can be no confusion.
One term that is often incorrect in academic papers is the nonlinear convection
vector

$$
\begin{equation}
u_j \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}.
\label{_auto32}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Here, if we accept the latter definition, with \( \nabla \bs{u} =
\partial u_j / \partial x_i \), then we can write this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\bs{u} \cdot \nabla \bs{u}.
\label{_auto33}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
However, if we choose to use the definition \( \nabla \bs{u} = \partial u_i / \partial x_j \),
then one must write
$$
\begin{equation}
 \nabla \bs{u} \cdot \bs{u}.
\label{_auto34}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
One common way to avoid any confusion is to define the convection operator
\( \bs{u} \cdot \nabla \) 

$$
\begin{equation}
\bs{u} \cdot \nabla = u_i \frac{\partial }{\partial x_i},
\label{_auto35}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
and then write the nonlinear convection term as

$$
\begin{equation}
(\bs{u} \cdot \nabla) \bs{u}.
\label{_auto36}
\end{equation}
$$

<h3 id="sec:div_tensor" class="anchor">The divergence of a tensor</h3>

Similarly to the gradient, there may be confusion when taking the divergence of
a tensor. According to the definition in Eq. \eqref{eq:divu}, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\text{div}\, \bs{P} = \frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial x_j}. \label{eq:divP}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
However, if we identify the nabla operator as a vector and not an operator,
then we have that the dot product of the nabla vector and \( P \)

$$
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \bs{P} = \frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial x_i},
\label{_auto37}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
and this is different from Eq. \eqref{eq:divP} since summation is over the first
index of \( \bs{P} \). On the other hand, if \( \nabla \cdot \) is seen as an operator acting
on \( \bs{P} \) one may get

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \bs{P} &= \frac{\partial P_{ij} \bs{i}_i \otimes \bs{i}_j}{\partial
x_k} \cdot \bs{i}_k, 
\label{_auto38}\\
 &= \frac{\partial P_{ij} }{\partial x_j}.
\label{_auto39}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
Both definitions are equally valid and ok, as long as it is made perfectly clear
which one is being used. However, only for the latter definition does \( \nabla
\cdot \) agree with the divergence operator \eqref{eq:divu}.
